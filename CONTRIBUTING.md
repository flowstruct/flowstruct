## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20)
- Java 20
- PostgreSQL 16.9 (local install or via Docker)

### Getting Started

Flowstruct consists of two frontends (Content, CMS) and a backend + database.
In production, the CMS is built and statically served,
while the content uses server-side rendering (SSR) via a Node.js runtime to serve the content pages.
The backend requires a Java runtime to serve responses to both frontends.

### Backend

The backend is a Spring Boot application that connects to a PostgreSQL database (on port 5433).

> Use ``Docker`` for running the database, as it makes it easy to wipe volumes if youâ€™re planning schema-level
> changes.

1. Navigate to the ``api`` folder
2. Run ``docker compose up -d`` to start the database
3. Configure Spring Boot to use the ``dev`` profile
4. Run `` mvn spring-boot:run`` to start the backend

### Frontend (CMS)

The CMS is built using React + Vite and written in TypeScript

1. Navigate to the ``client`` folder
2. Run ``pnpm install`` to install dependencies (across both frontends)
3. Run ```pnpm start:cms``` to start the CMS

### Frontend (Content)

The content uses server-side rendering (SSR) via a Node.js runtime to serve the content pages.

1. Navigate to the ``client`` folder
2. Run ``pnpm install`` (if you haven't already from before)
3. Run ```pnpm start:content``` to start the content server
